## Overview
The Credit Risk Prediction Model is designed to classify customers as either "Good Risk" or "Bad Risk" based on their financial and personal information. This can help financial institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals and credit limits.

## Features
- Predicts credit risk based on input features such as age, sex, job type, housing status, saving accounts, checking accounts, credit amount, duration, and purpose.
- Uses Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models for prediction.
- Deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web application.
