## Overview
The Credit Risk Prediction Model is designed to classify customers as either "Good Risk" or "Bad Risk" based on their financial and personal information. This can help financial institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals and credit limits.

## Features
- Predicts credit risk based on input features such as age, sex, job type, housing status, saving accounts, checking accounts, credit amount, duration, and purpose.
- Uses Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models for prediction.
- Deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web application.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-risk-predict.git
   cd credit-risk-predict
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the app.

Enter the customer details in the provided fields and click on the "Predict" button to get the credit risk prediction.
Model Training
The model is trained using the following steps:

Load and preprocess the data.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Scale the features.

Train the models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).

Evaluate the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Deployment
The model is deployed using Streamlit. The app allows users to input customer details and get a prediction of their credit risk.
